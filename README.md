## Business Scenario
- We are working for a consumer finance company that specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers.
- When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide on a loan approval based on the applicant's profile.
- Two types of risks associated with the bank's decision:
  - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
  - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, meaning that he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to financial loss for the company

## Objectives
- Identify the patterns that indicate if a person is likely to default. 
- These will be used for taking actions such as
  - Denying the loan
  - Reducing the amount of loan
  - Lending to risky applicants at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Details about the Data Provided
There are three possible scenarios mentioned here.
- __*Fully Paid*__: As the category says, the borrower has paid off the whole amount and has cleared the loan
- __*Current*__: As the category says, the borrower is currently in the process of paying off the loan
- __*Charged-off*__: This means that the borrower has defaulted on his/her loan and has not paid back the money

## Purpose of the Case Study
- By identifying the factors involved in the defaulting of loans, the bank can then make informed, data-driven decisions on whether a particular applicant is prone to defaulting or can pay off the loan and then accept the application for a loan grant or reject it outright.
- Through this process, the bank can then mitigate the losses made due to loan defaulting and increase business as well when loans are paid off.
